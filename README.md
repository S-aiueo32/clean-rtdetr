# Clean RT-DETR

A readable RT-DETR reference implementation with composable research extensions.
The design separates model variants, training methods, and experiment recipes
from deployment transformations.

## Current implementation

The current slice implements **multi-scale features → projected memory → selected
queries → iterative decoder predictions** in PyTorch.

- Frozen feature/query contracts with jaxtyping shape/dtype annotations and eager validation.
- Decoder input projection, row-major flattening, and explicit level offsets.
- Anchor generation and top-k selection preserving upstream masking semantics.
- Feature-content detach and differentiable encoder auxiliary predictions.
- DN-ready query assembly with an explicit reference-logit detach boundary.
- Self-attention, multi-scale deformable cross-attention, and iterative box refinement.
- Explicit decoder execution/output plans instead of implicit inference-layer selection.
- Forward and gradient parity tests against SHA-256-pinned upstream methods.

This is not yet a complete detector. Backbone, HybridEncoder, denoising construction,
training criteria, official checkpoint conversion, COCO evaluation, and export remain
to be implemented. No AP, latency, or complete-model parity is claimed. The included
example uses synthetic features and randomly initialized weights.

## Research direction

The [design proposal](docs/design-proposal.md) describes the planned
`ModelVariant × TrainingMethod × ExperimentRecipe` composition. RT-DETRv3's
auxiliary branches, RT-DETRv4-style distillation, DEIM recipes, and D-FINE-style
distribution refinement inform these boundaries. They are design targets, not
implemented integrations. New regression representations may replace an entire
decoder/selector boundary rather than conforming to RT-DETR coordinate deltas.

See the [implementation roadmap](docs/roadmap.md) and the
[extension example](docs/extensions.md) for the next concrete steps.
